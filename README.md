This website features a digital Harry-Potter style "Sorting Hat" with functionality to "sort" unlimited users/person of choice into one of the four Hogwarts houses at random.

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is Harry Potter fan who does not have time to fill out a sorting quiz, or does not trust the potential inherent bias in answering questions about oneself in personality quizzes
- For example, a user who knows her sister would be a Slytherin, but that sister claims she always is sorted to Ravenclaw based on easy-to-manipulate online sorting hat-style quizzes
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to compromise via a quick, completely random sorting style that is sure to prevent numerous arguments at Thanksgiving

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a user submits information via form, a "student" object is created in an existing array which is rendered to the DOM by house value
- A student object can be "expelled" via a button on the student card and removed from the student array, and pushed into a "Voldemort's Army" array that is rendered below the student houses
- Students can be filtered by house on the display screen via a drop-down form field
- If no image link is provided when a user submits a student, a generic Hogwarts logo will be used for their card
